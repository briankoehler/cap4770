# CAP4770 Assignment 5
**Brian Koehler (UFID: 7551-8931)**

## Implementation
Like the previous assignment, I implemented the code using Jupyter Notebook (`a5.ipynb`).  When opened, you may run all cells or examine the output that is already shown.  There are 7 sections to the notebook:

1. Packages and Imports
2. Pre-Processing
3. K-Means
4. K-Medoids
5. Affinity Propagation
6. Hierarchical Clustering
7. GMM Model

Sections 3-6 are the clustering techniques from Clustering.jl, while section 7 is the GMM found in GaussianMixtures.jl.

## Data
The CSV file for this assignment should be named `01_hdp.csv` and be located in the same directory as `a5.ipynb`.

## Report
The report for this assignment can be found in the same directory as this README.  It is a PDF.  Each algorithm is boldened and underlined, and each topic about the algorithm is only boldened.  There should be 3 pages to the PDF.
